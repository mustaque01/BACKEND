//MongoDB is the most popular open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database, 
// holding over 45% of the NoSQL market share. Unlike relational databases that
//  rely on rigid tables, MongoDB stores data in a flexible BSON format
//  (similar to JSON), enabling faster and more efficient storage and retrieval.
