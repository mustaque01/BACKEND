Backend Development Journey 🚀
Welcome to my backend development learning repository! 👋 This space is my personal playground and a collection of projects, notes, and exercises as I dive deep into the world of server-side development. My primary focus is on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, along with other essential backend technologies.

What's Inside? 📂
This repository is organized by topic. Each folder contains code and examples related to a specific concept or technology.

Node.js Fundamentals 📝: Core concepts of Node.js, including modules (math.js), file systems, and built-in packages.

Express.js 🌐: A deep dive into the Express framework, covering:

middleware: Understanding and creating custom middleware.

Routing: Building clean and efficient route handlers.

EJSDir: Using EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as a templating engine to render dynamic HTML.

RESTFUL APIs 📡: Designing, building, and testing RESTful APIs from scratch. This includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Databases 🗄️: Exploring how to connect and interact with different types of databases.

MONGO: Working with MongoDB and Mongoose for NoSQL database operations.

Node With SQL: Integrating SQL databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) with a Node.js application.

Utilities & Fun Stuff ✨:

figletDir: Small, fun projects using libraries like Figlet to create ASCII art.

Technology Stack 💻
Here are the primary technologies you'll find in this repository:

Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express.js

Databases: MongoDB (with Mongoose), SQL

Templating Engine: EJS

Language: JavaScript

How to Run a Project 🛠️
Most of the folders are self-contained Node.js projects. To run any of them:

Navigate to the project folder:

Bash

cd <folder_name>
# Example: cd RESTFUL_APIs
Install the necessary dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Run the application:

Bash

node index.js
# (or app.js, server.js depending on the project's entry file)
My Goal 🎯
My goal is to use this repository to document my learning, solidify my understanding of backend concepts, and build a portfolio of my skills. Feel free to explore the code!
